methods_long: This model is an extended SEIR model with additional compartments for the vaccinated, hospitalized, and death. It is designed as an age-structured model and is calibrated to reported hospitalizations. The fitted parameters are then used to forecast the number of hospitalizations, accounting for seasonal variations based on these parameters.
