team_model_designation: secondary
methods: Age-specific compartmental model with cohort aging, accounting for repeated infections, waning immunity, maternal immunity, seasonality, age-specific contact patterns, etc.
method_long: Age-specific compartmental model with cohort aging. We simulate RSV transmission and hospitalizations across age groups, accounting for repeated infections, waning immunity, maternal immunity, seasonality, age-specific contact patterns, etc as well as for  intervention effects. The model tracks monthly cohort aging and integrates both vaccination and natural infection dynamics.
