methods:
  Age-structured deterministic SEIR-H model with seasonality, hospitalization,
  ageing, waning immunity, and two immunization strategies: maternal vaccine
  and long-acting monoclonal antibodies.

data_inputs:
  Weekly age-stratified RSV hospital admissions from sentinel surveillance,
  population demographics by age band, and seasonal contact patterns.
  Parameter priors for transmission, recovery, and hospitalization are drawn
  from published RSV literature and calibration data.

methods_long:
  The SEIR-H model is a deterministic age-structured framework for RSV
  transmission. It divides the population into six age groups with susceptible,
  exposed, infectious, recovered, and hospitalized states, including immunized
  compartments for maternal vaccination and long-acting monoclonal antibodies.
  Transmission is seasonal and age-dependent, with births, aging, and waning
  immunity. The model is calibrated to weekly age-specific RSV hospitalizations
  and used to simulate intervention scenarios for forecasting hospital burden.
