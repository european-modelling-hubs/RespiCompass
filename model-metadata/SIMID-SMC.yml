team_model_designation: primary
methods: This COVID-19 meta-population model is an adaptation of the framework from the study “The impact of quality-adjusted life years on evaluating COVID-19 mitigation strategies: lessons from age-specific vaccination roll-out and variants of concern in Belgium (2020-2022), Willem et al., 2024.” The model categorizes the population into four age groups as defined by the ECDC scenarios. Furthermore, the original two-strain submodels have been simplified to single-strain submodels due to insufficient data for accurate parameterization. The model has been calibrated using Turing.jl.
