data_inputs: The following information is provided by the ECDC RSV - Round 1 2025/2026 Scenarios: vaccine waning curves, number of births, vaccine hospitalization effectiveness; The vaccine effectiveness against infection and severe outcomes was obtained the data from Ref[3], Figure 1.  [3] https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanepe/article/PIIS2666-7762(23)00248-X/fulltext  ; For developing the social model we used population pyramid and contact matrices for Spain and Italy.
