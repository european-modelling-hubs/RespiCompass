methods: An agent-based modelling framework tailored for the German population to simulate epidemics.
data_inputs: RKI 
team_model_designation: primary
methods_long: GEMS is an agent-based mathematical modelling framework tailored for the German population. Individuals in the model have attributes such as age and gender and are associated with contact settings that include households, schools, workplaces and municipality. Disease progression is age-dependent and seasonality effects are included. The model is calibrated using reported cases of hospitalizations and used to forecast COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations.
