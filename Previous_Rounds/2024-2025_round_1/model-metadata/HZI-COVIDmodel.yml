methods_long: This model is an extended SEIR model with additional compartments for the vaccinated, hospitalized, intensive unit, long-COVID, and death. It is designed as an age-structured model and is calibrated to reported cases and hospitalizations. The fitted parameters are then used to forecast the number of cases and hospitalizations, accounting for seasonal variations based on these parameters.
