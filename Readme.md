# ❗️ RespiCompass Latest Scenario Round: [RSV 2025/26](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCompass/blob/main/round1_2526_rsv.md)
For information regarding the call for the latest RespiCompass scenario round on RSV see the [dedicated Readme file](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCompass/blob/main/round1_2526_rsv.md). 
Deadline for submissions is 2025/12/01.




## RespiCompass Rationale 
With many uncertain factors at play, it is challenging to predict respiratory virus burden in forthcoming winter seasons. However, by combining data from national surveillance systems with published scientific evidence, expert knowledge, and leveraging expertise from global modelling groups, this respiratory disease scenario modelling hub provides public health advisors and policy decision-makers at European, national, or subnational level with robust insights into plausible winter season scenarios. This hub provides guidance—a "compass"—to support public health stakeholders in their long-term planning and anticipatory action. Secondly, such a hub builds a synergistic community of policy advisors, policy makers and modellers and brings modelling closer to decision making.

## How to Join RespiCompass
RespiCompass welcomes modelling teams willing to contribute their projections. Detailed information on how to join are provided in the [Wiki](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCompass/wiki). Here’s a concise guide on how to participate:

1. **Create a metadata file**:
   - Include key information about your team and model.
   - read more [detailed instructions to create a metadata file](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCompass/wiki/Metadata).

2. **Develop your model and model projections**:
   - Develop your model and produce projections. We value diverse model approaches and implementations.
   - Ensure your projections respect the provided scenario assumptions (refer to specific rounds information).

3. **Submit model projections**:
   - Follow the [submission format guidelines](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCompass/wiki/Submission-format).
   - Submit your projections by following the [instructions to open a pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCompass/wiki/Submitting-using-GitHub-Website).
