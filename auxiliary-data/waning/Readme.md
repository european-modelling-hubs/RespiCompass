# Waning of immunity 

Teams are encouraged to incorporate the waning of immunity conferred by both la-mAbs and MV into their models. To facilitate this, we provide the file [waning_curves.csv](./waning_curves.csv), which contains immunity waning data derived from Ref. [1]. Specifically, the file includes the following columns:

- ```days_post_intervention```: days post-immunisation
- ```la_mAbs```: waning of la-mAbs immunity. This is expressed as the percentage of the initial la-mAbs protection at day 0 (i.e., 50.0 indicates that the la-mAbs protection is reduced to 50% of the initial level)
- ```mv_neonates```: waning of MV immunity for neonates, with the same interpretation as ```la_mAbs```.
- ```mv_pregnant```: waning of MV immunity for pregnant individuals, with the same interpretation as ```la_mAbs```.
- ```la_mAbs_severe```: waning of la-mAbs protection against severe RSV disease, with the same interpretation as ```la_mAbs```.
- ```mv_neonates_severe```: waning of MV protection against severe RSV disease for neonates, with the same interpretation as ```la_mAbs```.
- ```mv_pregnant_severe```: waning of MV protection against severe RSV disease for pregnant individuals, with the same interpretation as ```la_mAbs```.

These data were extracted from Figure 2 of Ref. [1], specifically the mean values of the waning curves. The figure shows the proportion of individuals protected over time, with the x-axis representing days post-immunisation and the y-axis the corresponding protection levels. The authors employed a Bayesian framework to estimate the efficacy and waning of protection using clinical trial data for MV and la-mAB. They assumed vaccine-induced immunity wanes according to an Erlang distribution with shape parameter 3. The values that we report here are the mean values of these waning curves divided by the initial protection level and expressed as a percentage.

In Ref. [1], efficacy against milder and more severe outcomes is modelled considering efficacy against the following outcomes:

- Milder outcomes:
    - MV (neonates): infection, symptomatic cases, GP consultations
    - MV (pregnant women): infection, symptomatic cases, GP consultations, A&E; 
    - la-mAB: infection, symptomatic cases, GP consultations, A&E and hospitalisation. 
- Severe outcomes:
    - MV (neonates): severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)
    - MV (pregnant women): severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI)
    - la-mAB: very severe LRTI


We refer teams also to Ref. [2] (Figure 3) for additional data on the waning of immunity conferred by la-mAbs against various clinical outcomes of RSV.
