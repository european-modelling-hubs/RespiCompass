# RSV - Round 1 2025/2026 Scenarios
- Submission deadline: 2025/XX/XX

### ⚠️⚠️⚠️ Warning
The repository is currently under construction for the 2025/2026 scenario round. All information is not final and subject to change until this message is removed.


## Background
### RSV Burden in the EU/EEA
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of respiratory infections across the EU/EEA. The burden of disease is particularly high in older adults, individuals with underlying comorbidities, and young children [1-4]. Depending on the country, RSV-related hospitalisations account for 7% to 52% of all paediatric respiratory hospitalisations, representing approximately 250,000 annual hospital admissions in the entire EU/EEA [1]. Approximately 75% of these cases occur in infants under one year of age [1].

### Recently Authorised Infant RSV Interventions
In October 2022, a new extended half-life monoclonal antibody, nirsevimab (Beyfortus®, AstraZeneca/Sanofi), was authorised in the EU [5]. This product provides passive immunisation to protect infants during their first RSV season [6]. In June 2023, a maternal RSV vaccine (Abrysvo®, GSK) was also authorised in the EU [7]. Vaccination of pregnant individuals between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation has been shown to significantly reduce severe RSV-related respiratory infections in their infants during the
first six months of life [8,9]. Additional RSV vaccines and extended half-life monoclonal antibodies are currently in phase 2/3 clinical trials.

### Need for Evidence to Support Decision-Making
With the recent EU authorisation of these immunisation products, several EU/EEA countries have started or will soon begin the decision-making process on whether and how to introduce them into national programmes. Decisions on changing national immunisation programmes require consideration of multiple factors, including disease burden and epidemiology, the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of new interventions, ease of implementation, population acceptance, and national health priorities. Mathematical and health economic modelling can support decision-making by estimating the potential impact of interventions on health outcomes and healthcare systems, projecting cost-effectiveness, exploring uncertainty, and supporting comparisons across policy options [10-13].

### The RespiCompass 2025/26 RSV Scenario Round
The RespiCompass 2025/26 RSV Scenario round aims to produce evidence through ECDC-coordinated collaborative modelling on the population-level impact of the new infant RSV immunisation interventions. The project will produce outputs designed to support country-level health economic evaluations and decision-making around the introduction of these products. This project round will focus exclusively on universal infant immunisation strategies. It will not cover novel immunisation products targeting the RSV burden in older adults or strategies specifically targeting at-risk newborns.

## RSV Modelling Scenarios

### Goal and Objectives
The overall goal of this scenario modelling round is to generate evidence supporting country-level decisions on the introduction of novel infant RSV immunisation strategies. This will be achieved comparing scenarios with maternal vaccination or scenarios with monoclonal antibodies against no-intervention baselines with respect to the following key outputs:
- Estimate of the seasonal RSV hospitalisations averted in the entire EU/EEA, and in individual EU/EEA countries. This reduction in the hospitalisation burden will be reported as a proportion and as a total number.

- Estimate of the number of infant hospitalisations averted per 100 infants immunised for the EU/EEA and at country-level, which can be converted into country-specific costs.

### Table of Proposed Scenarios
To achieve this goal, this project round will model the following five scenarios. This structure allows for a clear comparison between the two primary interventions at different coverage levels and a baseline counterfactual. At the same time, the scenario selection accounts for the resource constraints of this project that strongly limits the possible number of modelling scenarios.

| | **High Coverage**. Coverage of the intervention assumed to be at 80% of the target population | **Low Coverage**. Coverage of the intervention assumed to be at 20% of the target population |
|  :-:|  :-: | :-: |
| **mAb only**. La-mAbs administered to newborns at birth starting on September $1^{st}$ and ending on March $31^{st}$ of the next year | Scenario A | Scenario B |
| **MV only**. MV administered during antenatal care visits, with immunization campaigns such that first immunized infants are born on $1^{st}$ of September and the last immunized infants are born on $31^{st}$ of March of the next year | Scenario C | Scenario D |
| **No Immunisation**. No intervention is implemented, all infants remain at risk of RSV infection and hospitalization based on historical transmission patterns $^*$.| Scenario E  (Baseline scenario) |  |

$^*$ Teams should use target data provided in the [target-data](https://github.com/european-modelling-hubs/RespiCompass/tree/main/target-data) folder to estimate typical hospitalisation patterns in absence of interventions. In other words, the target data is the baseline scenario and models should be calibrated to match the target data as closely as possible in Scenario E.

The selection of these scenarios is guided by the need to prioritise the most pressing policy questions within the project's resource constraints. The rationale for the proposed design is as follows:

- **Focus on single interventions (MV and mAbs)**: The scenario design focuses on comparing the two main options for immunising infants against severe RSV (maternal vaccination and monoclonal antibodies) to a no-intervention baseline. This reflects the current decision-making landscape in the EU/EEA, where many countries are weighing whether to introduce any RSV intervention and which strategy to prioritise for newborn protection.

- **Two coverage levels**: Expected immunisation coverage is a key uncertainty in any new immunisation programme. Modelling two distinct levels (low and high) for each intervention increases the country-relevance of the results. It also allows for an assessment of the linearity of impact with respect to coverage.

- **Inclusion of a baseline scenario**: The proposal includes a baseline scenario in which neither MV nor mAbs are implemented. This is essential to establish a counterfactual reference point for estimating the public health impact and added value of the novel interventions.

Additionally, this focused scenario round is designed not only to answer immediate policy questions but also to build RSV modelling capacity within the EU/EEA. It will create a strong foundation for potential follow-up projects that could address more complex or country-specific questions in the future.
